By Tim Hoffmann

[**Live Demo**](https://timdhoffmann.github.io/ma2-phaser-minesweeper-distribution/)

## 1.1. Environment Requirements

### 1.1.1. Repository

This repository uses Git LFS (large file storage). Make sure to have Git LFS installed and configured when cloning. Otherwise, download the ZIP file directly from Github.

### 1.1.2. Phaser 3 Webpack Project Template

This project is based on the [Phaser 3 Webpack Project Template](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-project-template).
A Phaser 3 project template with ES6 support via [Babel 7](https://babeljs.io/) and [Webpack 4](https://webpack.js.org/)
that includes hot-reloading for development and production-ready builds.

Loading images via JavaScript module `import` is also supported.

#### 1.1.2.1. Requirements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is required to install dependencies and run scripts via `npm`.

#### 1.1.2.2. Available Commands

| Command         | Description                                                                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`   | Install project dependencies                                                    |
| `npm start`     | Build project and open web server running project                               |
| `npm run build` | Builds code bundle with production settings (minification, uglification, etc..) |

#### 1.1.2.3. Writing Code

After cloning the repo, run `npm install` from your project directory. Then, you can start the local development
server by running `npm start`.

After starting the development server with `npm start`, you can edit any files in the `src` folder
and webpack will automatically recompile and reload your server (available at `http://localhost:8080`
by default).

#### 1.1.2.4. Deploying Code

After you run the `npm run build` command, your code will be built into a single bundle located at 
`dist/bundle.min.js` along with any other assets you project depended. 

If you put the contents of the `dist` folder in a publicly-accessible location (say something like `http://mycoolserver.com`), 
you should be able to open `http://mycoolserver.com/index.html` and play your game.

## 1.2. Style Guide

The project uses _JavaScript Standard Style_ [StandardJS](https://standardjs.com/index.html) as a style guide, linter and code formatter.
