By Tim Hoffmann

[**Live Demo**](https://timdhoffmann.github.io/ma2-phaser-minesweeper-distribution/)

## 1.1. Environment Requirements

### 1.1.1. Repository

This repository uses Git LFS (large file storage). Make sure to have Git LFS installed and configured when cloning. Otherwise, binary files will be missing (this also applies to downloading the zipped repository from GitHub).

### 1.1.2. Phaser 3 Webpack Project Template

This project is based on the [Phaser 3 Webpack Project Template](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-project-template).
A Phaser 3 project template with ES6 support via [Babel 7](https://babeljs.io/) and [Webpack 4](https://webpack.js.org/)
that includes hot-reloading for development and production-ready builds.

Loading images via JavaScript module `import` is also supported.

#### 1.1.2.1. Requirements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is required to install dependencies and run scripts via `npm`.

#### 1.1.2.2. Available Commands

| Command         | Description                                                                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`   | Install project dependencies                                                    |
| `npm start`     | Build project and open web server running project                               |
| `npm run build` | Builds code bundle with production settings (minification, uglification, etc..) |

#### 1.1.2.3. Writing Code

After cloning the repo, run `npm install` from your project directory. Then, you can start the local development
server by running `npm start`.

After starting the development server with `npm start`, you can edit any files in the `src` folder
and webpack will automatically recompile and reload your server (available at `http://localhost:8080`
by default).

#### 1.1.2.4. Deploying Code

After you run the `npm run build` command, your code will be built into a single bundle located at `dist/bundle.min.js` along with any other assets you project depended.

If you put the contents of the `dist` folder in a publicly-accessible location (say something like `http://mycoolserver.com`),
you should be able to open `http://mycoolserver.com/index.html` and play your game.

## 1.2. Style Guide

The project uses _JavaScript Standard Style_ [StandardJS](https://standardjs.com/index.html) as a style guide, linter and code formatter.
